vary color of latest post by passing into the declaration on index.html

(default) #ffcbbc - romantic (button color: #e6937c)
#ffdbbc - flirty (button color: #e6ad7c)
#FFB1B3 - sundown (button color: #e67276)

I'm thinking to define the colors and their button colors in CSS. Then pass an array into front matter and see if you can call attr[0] and attr[1] for color and button-color respectively
