            <h5>Tech Foundations</h5>
            <p>For as long as I can remember, I've been involved with technology. My father worked as a sales engineer in computing and server administration, so we always had the latest tech and video game consoles at home. Still, I wanted to become a doctor and so, once I got to college, I eagerly declared a Biology major.</p>
            
            <h5>My Wordpress Hustle</h5>
            <p>My first real interest in web development began when I started configuring Wordpress blogs for my college friends. After graduating (and deciding to pursue Public Health instead of medicine), my Wordpress hustle slowly grew into implementing simple websites for solo entrepreneurs and small local businesses. The most exciting part about my work was leveraging technology to meet my clients' business needs. Need a contact form with custom routing upon submission? Done! Need a backend catalog to track inventory and sales? Done! I felt a veritable rush every time a client reported back about their efficiency gains. So much so that, after having my first child, I decided to leave my job as a public health Analyst, and grow my freelance company while being more available to my son.</p>
            
            <h5>The Plunge - Coding Bootcamp</h5>
            <p>A few years into freelancing, I was growing increasingly frustrated with my inability to customize my Wordpress websites beyond rudimentary CSS changes. I began looking into learning to code, and took several mini-bootcamps before settling with The Firehose Project - a 6-month fulltime online bootcamp that focused on Rails and Javascript. On Day 1 of bootcamp, my second child - a daughter - was just 4 months old. What followed was a grueling period of juggling coding assignments with breastfeeding, all while sleep-deprived and in pain from my challenging c-section. But I was determined to make it through; I graduated bootcamp in July 2018. On to job-hunting.</p>
            
            <h5>The Stings of Rejection</h5>
            <p>Admittedly, this was the most demoralizing period of my coding journey. Any confidence that I would be scooped up by some cool company dazzled by my coding brilliance, was steadily whittled away as each rejection email rolled in. In a 5 month period, I was invited to 2 onsite interviews, and I failed to land either job. When the responsiveness of recruiters slowed in December, I vowed that if I hadn't landed a coding job by the new year, I would go back to freelancing and use my new programming skills within that context.</p>
            
            <h5>A Turn In The Winds</h5>
            <p>Within the first week on 2019, I had landed 4 new freelance clients, and was feeling quite hopeful about taking my agency to the next level. One random day, I received a call from a recruiter I had spoken with some months back, though no opportunities had come of our conversations. In a nutshell, she had a fantastic entry-level dev position - would I be able to interview tomorrow? "What's the process?" I asked. "One interview, after which a decision will be made," she replied. She emailed me the details for the interview, which was a pleasant conversation with a panel of 4 engineers. They were particularly interested in my non-traditional journey, asking about what challenges I'd overcome and how. They were impressed to hear that I'd led a discussion at my first tech conference (Tech, Rebalanced 2018), without the validation of a coding job. Minutes after the interview, the recruiter called back with the news I'd been waiting for: I got the job!</p>
