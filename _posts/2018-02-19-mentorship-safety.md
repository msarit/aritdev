As part of my web development program, I’ve been paired with a fantastic mentor (shout out, [Jeremy](http://takeonrules.com/)!). We’ve completed only one session; yet, I want to share on how his mentoring is already influencing my learning process.

**(1) I feel more secure**: Before Jeremy, I had access to course instructors and other students, but there’s something so comforting about having my “own person” to whom I can reveal just how confused I am about what I’m learning.

**(2) I am more efficient**: Being able to glean from Jeremy’s expertise means I’m not pressured to research every single obscure concept I encounter to death. I read just enough not to be totally ignorant, make a note on what to ask Jeremy, then forge ahead with my learning.

**(3) I am more disciplined**: I’m loathe to be that mentee who is a royal waste of time and energy. My weekly meeting with Jeremy motivates me to work hard and possibly impress him (well, as much as a Ruby novice can impress a 10-year veteran anyways!). I want to keep proving to Jeremy that I am a worthy investment of his time and efforts.

When I think about the bulk of my professional life before this, mentorship has been largely absent. I wonder how much more accomplished I’d be today had I been proactive about finding and maintaining mentoring relationships. But no use crying over the proverbial spilt milk; I now see how indispensable mentorship is in building a successful career, and I intend to firmly incorporate it moving forward.
