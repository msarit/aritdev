I am excited to announce that I have launched my YouTube channel! 🎉🎉🎉 I will be sharing walkthroughs of how I build features and solve coding issues [at work](https://dev.to/devteam/welcoming-arit-amana-to-the-dev-team-2ihh). I will also be talking about topics that are relevant to non-traditional aspiring and early-career devs.

I hope you'll subscribe! 😄 Thanks for your support.

Here are a couple videos to whet your appetite:

* [DEV Takeover of the #Hacktoberfest Helpdesk (Liquid Tags)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3xTiHxHDb4U)
