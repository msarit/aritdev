When Timur Meyster, of <a href="https://careerkarma.com" target="_blank">Career Karma</a>, asked to host an Ask-Me-Anything with their squads, it was a most humbling moment; this meant the opportunity to encourage and embolden those who sought to transition into tech like I did. Our session was just amazing; I was awed by the determination I felt from the students, and they literally hailed from all career paths and walks of life. Spending time with Career Karma made me so hopeful for the future of tech, for its diversity, inclusivity and strength.

The recording of the AMA is below. Enjoy! ðŸ˜„
