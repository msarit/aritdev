Finally! I’m over the paralysis of writing my first blog post, thanks to my fellow Firehose Project classmates. While reading their blog posts, I realized that mine needn’t be a thesis-level exposition lol! So, having relaxed and taken a deep breath…

**My Journey Into Web Development**

1.  Pre-med biology major
2.  Dropped pre-med; kept Bio; dabbled in Wordpress
3.  Public-health postgrad
4.  Public-health researcher;  **_Wordpress side-hustle_**
5.  Married & a baby in the same year 💒 👶🏽 😩
6.  **_Let go from researcher job_**
7.  Wordpress freelancing (mostly)
8.  Baby #2! 🍼
9.  **_Self-learning HTML, CSS & JS_** 👩🏽‍💻
10. Completed several web-dev mini-bootcamps
11. **_Decided on and began The Firehose Project_**

That’s my story, in a nutshell :) The moments I consider significant appear in bold italics. Non-linear to be sure, and terrifying at times. I’m a career-switching mother-of-two in the process of becoming a developer.
