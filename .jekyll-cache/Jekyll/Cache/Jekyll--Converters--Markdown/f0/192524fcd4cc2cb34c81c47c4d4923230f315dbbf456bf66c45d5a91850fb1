I"<p>I am six months into my first dev job, and have had some time to reflect on my experience so far. I donâ€™t think I have ever been this in-tune with and plugged-in to a job; I think it is due to the very deliberate way I pivoted into my Software Engineering career. ğŸ˜‚</p>

<p>In particular, <strong>my inner dialogue while at work has changed significantly</strong>. When I started my job, I interpreted everything - every comment, every critique, every code review, every grimace at my code, EVERYTHING - as an indictment on my programming abilities. I came away from every code review with the refrain: â€œI need to get better, or they will not keep meâ€, or â€œIâ€™m never going to learn enough to be considered good at my jobâ€. It got so bad that if my manager, or the project lead, began walking towards my desk, I would think, â€œUh-oh, my code must be wrong; Iâ€™ve made a mistake again; Iâ€™ve broken stagingâ€ and on and onâ€¦</p>

<p>However, most of these moments when my code was scrutinized were not because my code was â€œwrongâ€. Instead, each moment tended to fall into one of the following buckets:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>The projectâ€™s specs were failing because my code - while right - was conflicting with another code block somewhere. Scenarios like these have led me to become more familiar with our codebases, and to always think in terms of how I can re-use and/or improve existing code.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The build test on my pull-request wasnâ€™t passing, or the code coverage was below threshold because I hadnâ€™t written tests for all functionality that I had added.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The method names I had chosen were not aligned with some naming conventions closely enough, or they just werenâ€™t clear enough to the code reviewer</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was one project where I was tasked to write specs for a large method. I was unaware that the team was expected to abstract away any component of that method that we were testing. So I wrote my test in the context of that larger method. When the reviewer sent my pull-request back as â€œwrongâ€, instead of internalizing the word â€œwrongâ€, I went over, defended the correctness of my test, and then discovered about the abstracting we were doing. I felt empowered after this incident; for the first time, I didnâ€™t cower in self-judgement.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>When I graduated bootcamp, I thought that the hardest part of my first dev job would be directly related to coding - learning, making mistakes, being corrected, learning again. However, the most challenging part has been overcoming my  negative self-talk and not projecting those emotions unto my teammates, making them â€œguiltyâ€ for â€œnot supportingâ€ me and my learning. I have become much better at not taking feedback and scrutiny personally. I am learning to speak up and defend coding decisions that I have made, even if I ultimately change what I coded. And I have finally started owning the truth that I AM a Software Engineer, and a damn good one too!</p>

<p>{% include tweet-card.html quote=â€As #CodeNewbies, let us silence negative self-talk and see feedback on our code for what it is: information we can use to become even better!â€ %}</p>

<p>I encourage anyone with the same struggles that I have discussed above: give voice to your internal dialogue and be willing to ask yourself why you are having those thoughts or drawing those conclusions. Look critically at the feedback you are receiving - does it really conclude with your â€˜ineptitudeâ€™? Or merely suggesting tweaks to your approach? Maybe that person just doesnâ€™t understand your code - not that your code is non-sensical? I think it is helpful to remind ourselves: <strong>Donâ€™t take it personal - at least, at first</strong>. This reminder can help us to step out of our negative self-talk and see feedback on our code for what it is: information we can use to become even better.</p>
