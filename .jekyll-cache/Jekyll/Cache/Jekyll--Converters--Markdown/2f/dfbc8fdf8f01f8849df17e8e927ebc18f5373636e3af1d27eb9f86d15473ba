I"Ì<p>I recently started the phase of my bootcamp where students tackle building a complex web application â€” a chess game â€” as part of an Agile Development Team.</p>

<p>I was equal parts exhilarated and terrified.</p>

<p>Hitherto, my apps have been for-my-eyes-only (and yes, also my mentorâ€™s and instructorsâ€™ â€” but they donâ€™t  <em>really</em>  count). Leading up to my teamâ€™s first stand-up, I found myself trying, and failing, to squelch my insecurities:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Do I know enough code to make meaningful contributions to this app?</li>
  <li>Will I get along with my team? Will they be inpatient with my pace and progress?</li>
  <li>Will I make a complete idiot, fool, ass, derriÃ¨re of myself?</li>
</ul>

<p>I have a checklist of coding milestones that I believe measure my maturity as a developer. Some have been a cup of tea (e.g. implement continuous integration for all my apps); others a bit more challenging (e.g. conduct an informational interview with a senior developer you donâ€™t know). But there was one item Iâ€™d always pretend wasnâ€™t there: â€œMake a purposeful contribution to an open-source project.â€ The prospect of attempting this milestone was dauntingâ€” open-source codebases are so â€¦ huge! And intricate! And huge! Since I was a child, Iâ€™ve always feared breaking things: mirrors, eggs, bones, and now code. In my mind, one mis-algorithm and the whole project would come screeching to a halt, and it wouldnâ€™t take the owners of the app long to sniff me out as the culprit.</p>

<p>Enter my team project. Working together on our chess app, feature-by-feature and method-by-method, has demystified the entire world of collaborative coding for me. Before now, GitHub had been just a cool place to store my code incase my laptop crashed. But OH! Is it so much more than that! Thereâ€™s forking, branching, pull requests, code reviews, code conflict resolution â€”  <strong>itâ€™s beautiful!</strong>  My fear of dismantling an app with a few lines of sub-standard code has melted away, replaced by the confidence that my contribution must clear several â€œhurdlesâ€ before it gets anywhere near the main codebase.</p>

<p>Another aspect of open-source participation that had me frozen was revealing to my collaborators just how little I knew. Never mind how often my mentor Jeremy and my bootcamp instructors encouraged me:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Donâ€™t ever be intimidated; everyone, even the â€˜expertâ€™, is still learning</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I still felt like Iâ€™d show up to the party in formal, all-white attire, only to find every other guest chilling in comfortable jeans.</p>

<p>Working on our chess app has taught me that, no matter how massive the codebase grows, every facet and functionality to be added is broken down into bite-sized, manageable pieces that I can focus in on and be responsible for. The realization that I will never be expected to bring Goliath down, be it with the chess app or any open-source project, is truly liberating. Instead of comparing my skill set or coding language fluency with others, and then cowering at the disparity, I can leverage the opportunity to learn-while-doing, through pair-programming or having my code reviewed (that sounds gentler than â€˜critiquedâ€™, doesnâ€™t it? ğŸ˜‰).</p>

<p>This week, I happened upon the repo of a cool-looking, uber-useful open-source app. Theyâ€™ve indicated that they are â€œfirst-timer-friendlyâ€ and the app has several open issues. I surprised even myself when I excitedly forked their repo and began familiarizing myself with their contributor guidelines. Iâ€™m an open-source contributor, people! ğŸ’ƒğŸ¾</p>
