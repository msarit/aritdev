I"~<p>As part of my current project — building an Instagram-like app called “Grammable” — I’m being introduced to the efficient world of Test-Driven Development. We’re using the RSpec gem to run tests on our Rails apps. I like it, I like it a lot. I appreciate being able to test my app’s functionality without reloading my browser a million times (no exaggeration).</p>
