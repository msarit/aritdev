I"k<p>This week’s coding challenge <a href="https://thefirehoseproject.com/">in my bootcamp</a>  had my brain all knotted up. I was already fatigued from solving (most of) 32 CodeWars katas, but I was scheduled to discuss said challenge — titled “Image Blur 2” — with my mentor Jeremy. I decided to see if I could make any sense of the challenge, which went as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong><em>Using Ruby, transform a grid of ones and zeroes such that any zeroes above, beneath and to the sides of a “1” are turned to “1”s (as depicted in the image below)</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>We are currently learning object-oriented programming, so I knew the resulting algorithm would consist of Class and Method definitions. But not even a snippet of a solution would come to me — not that evening, anyhow. So I decided to describe my would-be code in plain English:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Locate the cells with a value of “1”.</li>
  <li>Check whether there are rows above, beneath or to the sides of said cell.</li>
  <li>Check whether the cells adjacent to said cell in these rows have a value of 1.</li>
  <li>If yes, leave unchanged; if not, change the value of adjacent cells to 1.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>Location of cell-in-question: <em>array[row][column]</em></li>
  <li>Cell above: <em>array[row-1][column]</em></li>
  <li>Cell below: <em>array[row+1][column]</em></li>
  <li>Cell on Left: <em>array[row][column-1]</em></li>
  <li>Cell on Right: <em>array[row][column+1]</em></li>
</ul>

<p>The only code-y part of my write-up is the location of an element within the grid (<em>array[row][column]</em>). I emailed my write-up to Jeremy and called it a night. During our session the next day, Jeremy explained that the challenge consisted of 2 main objectives, and that my “vague” conceptualization had all-but-fulfilled the harder objective (whaa???). We spent the rest of the evening translating my write-up to actual code and creating test-cases to ensure my algorithm’s robustness.</p>

<p>This experience has markedly increased my confidence in approaching algorithms; before now, I believed that <strong>if I wasn’t “thinking in Ruby” from the get, then my work wasn’t really legit</strong>. After all, it is said that native speakers of a language THINK (not just speak) in that language, right? Well, I’m certainly not expert in Ruby (yet!), but I realize that it’s okay — even effective! — to translate from a language that I’m already comfortable with.</p>
