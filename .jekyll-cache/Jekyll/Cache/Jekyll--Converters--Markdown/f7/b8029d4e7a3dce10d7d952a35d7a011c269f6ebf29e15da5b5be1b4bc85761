I"§<p>Finally! Iâ€™m over the paralysis of writing my first blog post, thanks to my fellow Firehose Project classmates. While reading their blog posts, I realized that mine neednâ€™t be a thesis-level exposition lol! So, having relaxed and taken a deep breathâ€¦</p>

<p><strong>My Journey Into Web Development</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>Pre-med biology major</li>
  <li>Dropped pre-med; kept Bio; dabbled in Wordpress</li>
  <li>Public-health postgrad</li>
  <li>Public-health researcher;  <strong><em>Wordpress side-hustle</em></strong></li>
  <li>Married &amp; a baby in the same year ğŸ’’ ğŸ‘¶ğŸ½ ğŸ˜©</li>
  <li><strong><em>Let go from researcher job</em></strong></li>
  <li>Wordpress freelancing (mostly)</li>
  <li>Baby #2! ğŸ¼</li>
  <li><strong><em>Self-learning HTML, CSS &amp; JS</em></strong> ğŸ‘©ğŸ½â€ğŸ’»</li>
  <li>Completed several web-dev mini-bootcamps</li>
  <li><strong><em>Decided on and began The Firehose Project</em></strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Thatâ€™s my story, in a nutshell :) The moments I consider significant appear in bold italics. Non-linear to be sure, and terrifying at times. Iâ€™m a career-switching mother-of-two in the process of becoming a developer.</p>
