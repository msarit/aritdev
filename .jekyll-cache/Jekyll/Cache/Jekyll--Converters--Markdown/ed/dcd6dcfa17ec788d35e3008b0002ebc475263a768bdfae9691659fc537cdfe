I"¿<p>My team was building several React components for the front-end of what would be a highly-trafficked app. One of these components required that if the pageâ€™s subtitle was longer than 70 characters, we inserted a break at the 70-character point, for the sentence to continue on a new line. Checking the database, we determined that no pageâ€™s subtitle was longer than 140 characters. So weâ€™d probably need to break subtitles only once.</p>
