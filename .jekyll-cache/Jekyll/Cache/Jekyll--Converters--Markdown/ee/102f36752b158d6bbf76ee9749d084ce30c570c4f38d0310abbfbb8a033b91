I"×<p>I feel almost guilty to admit that itâ€™s taken me just shy of 3 weeks to write this post. If youâ€™ve followed my developer journey so far, youâ€™ve read about my coding challenges and triumphs, the safety Iâ€™ve felt from committed,  compassionate mentorship, and the lessons Iâ€™ve learned from teamwork.</p>

<p>All those stories emanated from the secure cocoon of being a coding bootcamper. Since graduating, Iâ€™ve now begun to experience the big wide world of job hunting, where Iâ€™m gingerly testing my developer wings barely dry from my 6-month Firehose Project tenure.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve wrestled with whether and how to continue documenting my journey. A part of me wishes that my glass-slipper-fits â€œyouâ€™re hired!â€ moment would happen almost immediately, so that I could write a glowing story of how I went from emailing my resume out, to sitting at my new work desk in record time and with minimal effort. With an embarrassed smile, I realize how validated and â€œauthenticâ€ such an outcome would make me feel.</p>

<p>I juggle phone screens, lengthy email threads, personal dev projects, open-source contributions, algorithm practice and further education, determined to present my best self to that hiring manager appointed to extend my first pro dev opportunity.</p>

<p>I thought that moment had arrived when I had my first onsite interview about 2 weeks ago. According to the hiring manager, I did better on the first-round coding exercise than some senior applicants â€” a revelation that sent warm ripples of pride through my being.</p>

<p>The next round was an hour-long conversation with one of the companyâ€™s founders, during which I expressed genuine interest in the companyâ€™s purpose and goals, and they further elaborated on company culture and priorities.</p>

<p>When I received the email inviting me to the final-round, 3-hour onsite interview, my stomach twisted into knots reinforced by nerves a-haywire.</p>

<p>What will they ask me? How intense will the white-boarding session be? Will I freeze? Will I crash?</p>

<p><strong><em>Will they hire me?</em></strong></p>

<p>The interview ended up being much more pleasant than I anticipated. The developer who led our panel discussion did an incredible job of setting me at ease. I found myself enjoying their questions, which were quite holistic and sought to get an all-round sense of who I was â€” emotionally, relationally, and professionally.</p>

<p>The technical exercises were unpressured and collaborative. I wasnâ€™t thrown to the piranhas and expected to prevail without a nick. I emerged from the interview feeling quite confident, 65â€“70% sure that Iâ€™d be extended an offer.</p>

<p>So when I got the rejection email â€” it was quite kind, detailed and explanatory â€” it knocked much of the wind out of me. I experienced several emotions, which I want to distill in the rest of this piece.</p>

<p>Why? Well, an article like this would have encouraged me a lot that day, and I would like to help other devs with similar stories give voice to their experience.</p>

<h2 id="shame"><strong>Shame</strong></h2>

<p>All my family, friends and mentors knew about my onsite interview. They had listened with bated breath as I replayed the questions and my answers, and each had prophesied my impending employment. So, yes, it was hard to answer their â€œDid you hear back yet?â€ phone calls with the unwelcome news.</p>

<p>It was even harder to hear the thinly-veiled disappointment for (not in) me in their donâ€™t-worry and you-got-this phrases. Itâ€™s a primal need that we humans share: the need to be validated. To be authenticated. To be wanted and to be valued.</p>

<p>It was all too easy for me to interpret not getting the position as an indictment on my ability â€” innate or learned â€” to be a software developer. Which led toâ€¦</p>

<h2 id="self-doubt"><strong>Self-doubt</strong></h2>

<p>This emotion dragged on longer than I would have admitted, were I not writing this quite transparent piece. All the knowledge gains and leaps I had experienced during my bootcamp now seemed so paltry and insignificant.</p>

<p>â€œYouâ€™re not enoughâ€¦ you donâ€™t know enoughâ€¦ you canâ€™t learn fast and deep enoughâ€¦ you wonâ€™t ever know enoughâ€¦â€ the refrain was unrelenting. Sometimes it was muted as I busied myself with projects and chores, always loudest as I snuggled into bed for the night.</p>

<p>My self-doubt had the potential of literally turning me back from my dreams, of causing me to extinguish the flame of purpose and faith that had spurred me past ever-competing priorities to my present position.</p>

<p>As I considered all that I had sacrificed and overcome to complete my bootcamp, I started using my voice. When a self-defeating thought penetrated my mind, I would articulate it out loud then add â€œâ€¦ and, Arit, you are wrongâ€<em>.</em></p>

<p>I reminded myself of every professional developer who gave me candid feedback during my learning, realizing that their judgment and assessment of me was trustworthy and sound. I rose, mentally, above my self-doubt, not trying to kill or silence it, but choosing to speak louder and more firmly than it did.</p>

<h2 id="introspection"><strong>Introspection</strong></h2>

<p>This was my segue to taking charge of my job-rejection experience. I went back to that email and analyzed it critically, realizing that avoiding it only granted it greater stinging power. All elevations â€” from the backyard hill to Everest â€” are scalable once we choose to view them as obstacles and not hindrances.</p>

<p>I took note of the strengths and weaknesses the interviewers identified in my presentation, and used them to adjust my job-hunting strategy moving forward. For example, when talking with hiring managers or senior devs, Iâ€™ve decided to broach the subject of just how supportive of new devs their job environment isâ€” upfront and candidly.</p>

<p>I also realized that the emailâ€™s level of detail was not typical of most rejection notices, and I became grateful for such feedback.</p>

<h2 id="hope"><strong>Hope</strong></h2>

<p>â€œIâ€™m after my one â€˜YESâ€™â€¦ five yesâ€™s would be nice, but not necessaryâ€¦â€ Once I allowed the observations of my interviewers run through me, and I received them as feedback on my  <strong>professional profile</strong>  and  <strong>not my intrinsic value</strong>, I began to hope again.</p>

<p>{% include tweet-card.html quote=â€Once I received my interviewersâ€™ observations as <strong>feedback on my  professional profile</strong>, not <strong>judgement on my intrinsic value</strong>, I began to hope againâ€ %}</p>

<p>This experience has made me less afraid of being transparent and vulnerable in my job search. I have reasserted my skills and abilities with confidence and boldness. Iâ€™ve devised non-traditional strategies for getting hiring managers, company owners and influential employees to notice me and grant me a conversation.</p>

<p>I have embraced my known unknowns with humility and a greater desire to locate that dev team that will catalyze my growth as a developer with enthusiasm and support.</p>

  <p>There is a certain randomness to the job-search process, but there is nothing haphazard about my intention of making significant contributions to this world as a developer.</p>
