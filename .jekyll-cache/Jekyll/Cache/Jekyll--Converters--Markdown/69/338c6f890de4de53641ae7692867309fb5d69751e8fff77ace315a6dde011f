I"”<p>I am 10 months into my first professional role as a developer, and it has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my life. Recently, someone asked me: What has contributed most to your success? <strong>Bar none, mentoring was crucial to my transition into a tech career.</strong> In coding bootcamp, I was assigned to <a href="https://arit.dev/mentorship-safety/" target="_blank">Jeremy</a>, who I would meet with once a week by video chat for 6 months. I was so overwhelmed and frustrated during the first few lessons, but Jeremyâ€™s patient instruction and unwavering support convinced me that I could really do this software development thing!</p>
