I"Ç<p>In recent weeks, several developers looking for their first dev job have asked me to review their resumes and/or portfolios, and give them tips on how to improve their profiles. Many of the issues I flagged appeared in most of the profiles I reviewed, so I decided to write this piece with some (unsolicited ðŸ˜Š) advice on how to avoid a flat, one-dimensional GitHub profile as a new software developer. The reality is that the market for new devs is becoming increasingly competitive, on account of more and more coding bootcamps churning out entry-level developers by the month. I think that the time spent crafting a unique, informative job-seeking profile is time well spent. So, onto the mistakes!</p>
