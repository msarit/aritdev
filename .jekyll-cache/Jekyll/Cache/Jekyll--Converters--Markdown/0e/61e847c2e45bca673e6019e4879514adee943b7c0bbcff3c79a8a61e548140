I"`<p>I recently wrapped up at <a href="https://thefirehoseproject.com/">The Firehose Project</a>. ðŸŽ‰ With 3 other remote developers, I built a chess application on Rails (with some JavaScript) using Agile Development principles. The 7-week project flew by so fast and, once I wrapped the bootcamp up, I crashed like spat-out bubblegum for a couple weeks (thatâ€™s what a 6-month, 30 hours/week online bootcamp will do to youâ€¦ but thatâ€™s another post ðŸ˜‰). I would like to reflect on some valuable lessons I learned during this project, lessons that have significantly influenced my developer ethos.</p>
