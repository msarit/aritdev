I"O<p>As part of my web development program, I’ve been paired with a fantastic mentor (shout out, <a href="http://takeonrules.com/">Jeremy</a>!). We’ve completed only one session; yet, I want to share on how his mentoring is already influencing my learning process.</p>

<p><strong>(1) I feel more secure</strong>: Before Jeremy, I had access to course instructors and other students, but there’s something so comforting about having my “own person” to whom I can reveal just how confused I am about what I’m learning.</p>

<p><strong>(2) I am more efficient</strong>: Being able to glean from Jeremy’s expertise means I’m not pressured to research every single obscure concept I encounter to death. I read just enough not to be totally ignorant, make a note on what to ask Jeremy, then forge ahead with my learning.</p>

<p><strong>(3) I am more disciplined</strong>: I’m loathe to be that mentee who is a royal waste of time and energy. My weekly meeting with Jeremy motivates me to work hard and possibly impress him (well, as much as a Ruby novice can impress a 10-year veteran anyways!). I want to keep proving to Jeremy that I am a worthy investment of his time and efforts.</p>

<p>When I think about the bulk of my professional life before this, mentorship has been largely absent. I wonder how much more accomplished I’d be today had I been proactive about finding and maintaining mentoring relationships. But no use crying over the proverbial spilt milk; I now see how indispensable mentorship is in building a successful career, and I intend to firmly incorporate it moving forward.</p>
