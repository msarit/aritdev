I"ý<p>Iâ€™m about 5 months into my first job as a developer. Officially, we do not have standard work-from-home days; however, we are allowed to work-from-home due to unplanned and unavoidable circumstances. <strong>In my case, most unplanned circumstances take the form of my 2-year-old daughter being sick.</strong> Iâ€™m grateful for the freedom to work at home when my child is sick, but I donâ€™t particularly look forward to it. For one, my productivity is affected; take, for example, the time lost waiting for a response on Slack vs. simply walking over to a teammates desk, or connectivity issues during meetings via video-conferencing. Now add to that a justifiably whiny child seeking your undivided attention, and itâ€™s the perfect frustration storm.</p>
